## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft purple (#A879D0), chosen for its association with sophistication, knowledge, and data-driven insight. This color provides a calming yet intellectual feel, suitable for an analytics platform.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F4F2F7), nearly white but with a hint of purple.  This keeps the focus on the content and reduces eye strain during extended use.
- Accent color: Teal (#45B5AA) as an analogous color to purple. It will provide contrast for calls to action and interactive elements without overpowering the main interface.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its modern and neutral appearance, ensuring readability and a clean aesthetic appropriate for a data-heavy application.
- Use a consistent style of line icons to represent data concepts, actions, and navigation elements.
- Implement a clean, data-focused layout that maximizes screen real estate for charts, tables, and analysis tools. Use a consistent grid system to align elements.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user interactions, such as loading data, filtering results, and navigating between sections.
